# SpeechToText
In this project our goal is to achieve the problem of converting audio data into textual data.


Speech Recognition is an important feature in several applications used such as home automation, artificial intelligence, etc. This article aims to provide an introduction on how to make use of the SpeechRecognition library of Python. This is useful as it can be used on microcontrollers such as Raspberri Pis with the help of an external microphone.
Speech recognition technologies such as Alexa, Cortana, Google Assistant and Siri are changing the way people interact with their devices, homes, cars, and jobs. The technology allows us to talk to a computer or device that interprets what we’re saying in order to respond to our question or command.
Popular digital assistants, include:
•	Amazon’s Alexa
•	Apple’s Siri
•	Google’s Google Assistant
•	Microsoft’s Cortana
